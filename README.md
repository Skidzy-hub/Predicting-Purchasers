The primary data mining tasks in this project are classification and regression. Classification is used to predict whether a customer is a purchaser or non-purchaser, optimizing the mailing strategy to minimize costs. Regression is employed to predict spending among purchasers, enabling the firm to estimate potential revenue and prioritize high-value customers. Logistic regression was chosen for classification due to its effectiveness in binary classification and probability estimation, while multiple linear regression was used for spending prediction to model continuous outcomes. Stepwise regression was applied to both tasks for feature selection, ensuring model simplicity and robustness by excluding irrelevant predictors. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was utilized to address multicollinearity among correlated variables, enhancing model stability. These techniques were selected for their ability to handle structured data, produce interpretable results, and provide actionable insights to refine the firmâ€™s marketing strategy.
